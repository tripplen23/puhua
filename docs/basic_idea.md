I want to create a Web App for learning Finnish language by speaking, let's call it "Puhua". The idea is to learn Finnish by speaking after spoken sentences - the shadowing technique for example from this video: [25 Finnish words to learn before 2025 | Learn Finnish by listening!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RAGo1vQcnY)

1. The video must be in Finnish language and firstly will be embedded into the app and the subtitles in Finnish and English will be generated by AI. (Not MVP)

2. Preview session: The users is firstly allowed to watch the whole video and they can skip this part to jump into the practice session. (MVP)

3. Practice session: The video will play for each sentence-by-sentence - the video will be stopped when a short sentence is finished, then allow users to record their voice based on this sentence, they can cancel the recording to record again or listen to the old sentence once again for controlling back their voice in speaking, when they finish the speaking or happy with their speaking record, they can choose to listen again their own voice and the actor's voice (from video) for comparation before jumping to the next sentence. (MVP)

4. Note taking feature: While speaking along with the video, there will be new words that the user will highlight and after the lesson, they will have a list of words that they are having trouble with, based on the context of the sentence, it can be used as a resource for AI to explain about grammar,... (MVP)

5. Evaluate and score each lesson (AI eval): After each speak record, AI can evaluate and give the tip to enhance the pronounce, accent or anything that help the users improve their Finnish language. And another case is after a spoken session, AI can evaluate generally and give the spoken score to the User on the bandscore of 5.
